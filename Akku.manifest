  (description "This is an R6RS Scheme library that provides a reader
with some extra features not found in the standard `read` procedure:"
               "* Source annotations."
               "* Tolerant mode that continues on errors."
               "* Compatible mode with support for other RnRS standards."
               "* Lexer that returns source code tokens, including whitespace.")
